# Nodot

> Nodot is referred as Node bot

This project is a Discord bot built with Node.js. It is the revamped version of my previous Node.js bot. It uses ES6+ JavaScript and is better structured.

## Features

- **Meme Sharing:** Automatically fetches and shares meme using meme command.
- **Quote Command:** Fetches a random quote from the api using quote command.
- **Profile Picture:** Displays profile picture of the user using pfp command.
- **Hack the user:** To hack someone, totally real and not a joke.
- **Help Command:** Help command to get started.

(**Note:** This bot is in its early stages of development. I'm planning to add more features in future as I get more ideas. It is a passion project that I work on in my free time.)
