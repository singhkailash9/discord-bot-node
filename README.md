# Nodot

> Nodot is referred as Node bot

This project is a Discord bot built with Node.js. It is the revamped version of my previous Node.js bot. It uses ES6+ JavaScript and is better structured. The bot supports hybrid commands (both traditional text based and new slash based commands).

## Commands

### 1. Fun Commands:

- **Meme Sharing:** Automatically fetches and shares meme using meme command.
- **Quote Command:** Fetches a random quote from the api using quote command.
- **Hack the user:** To hack someone, totally real and not a joke.

### 2. Utility Commands:

- **Profile Picture:** Displays profile picture of the user using pfp command.
- **Define Command:** Displays definition of the word using define command.
- **Userinfo Command:** Displays the detailed information of a user.

### 3. Misc. Commands:

- **Help Command:** Help command to get started.
- **Test Commands:** To test the embed and if the bot is active.


(**Note:** This bot is in its early stages of development. I'm planning to add more features in future as I get more ideas. It is a passion project that I work on in my free time.)
