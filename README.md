# Nodot

> Nodot is referred as Node bot

This project is a Discord bot built with Node.js. It is the revamped version of my previous Node.js bot. It uses ES6+ JavaScript and is better structured. The bot supports hybrid commands (both traditional text based and new slash based commands).

## Commands

### 1. Fun Commands:

- **Gif Sending:** Shares the related GIF from Tenor API using the query provided.
- **Meme Sharing:** Automatically fetches and shares meme using meme command.
- **Quote Command:** Fetches a random quote from the api using quote command.
- **Hack the user:** To hack someone, totally real and not a joke.

### 2. Poke Commands:

- **Pokemon Data:** Poke command to find information related to a pokemon. It displays Pokedex ID, Name, Type, description, species and the pokemon image. Use Poke command along with the name of the Pokemon.
<!-- - **Evolution line:** Displays the evolution line and evolution level of a Pokemon.
- **Base stat:** Shows the base stat of a Pokemon such as HP, atk, def, sp.atk, sp.def and speed.
- **Pokemon Profile:** Shows the profile of a pokemon such as ability, height, weight, gender ratio and egg type. -->

### 3. Utility Commands:

- **Profile Picture:** Displays profile picture of the user using pfp command.
- **Define Command:** Displays definition of the word using define command.
- **Userinfo Command:** Displays the detailed information of a user.

### 4. Misc. Commands:

- **Help Command:** Help command to get started.
- **Test Commands:** To test the embed and if the bot is active.


(**Note:** This bot is in its early stages of development. I'm planning to add more features in future as I get more ideas. It is a passion project that I work on in my free time.)
